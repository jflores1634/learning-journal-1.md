# Learning Journal 

## Week 2 Day 1

This is my learning journal. Welcome to the Dark side!

  - lessons learned
  - paired assignments
  - frustration

Today we started week 2. I understand most of the material. Typing it efficiently is something I will have to practice. I am slightly behind on my re submits but I don't think they will be an issue. As long as I time manage I should be able to catch up in no time.

## Week 2 Day 2

The constructors and table are a headache. Funny how we take for granted something that is already programmed like excel. 
Each location is its own object. 


## Week 2 Day 3

Reveiewing the code for the lab assignment in class helped me to learn how the constructor works and what I needed to do to my own code to make it work. I will need to work with my css and html to add the assets for the lab today.
