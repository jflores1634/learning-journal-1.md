# Learning Journal 

## Week 2 Day 1

This is my learning journal. Welcome to the Dark side!

  - lessons learned
  - paired assignments
  - frustration

Today we started week 2. I understand most of the material. Typing it efficiently is something I will have to practice. I am slightly behind on my re submits but I don't think they will be an issue. As long as I time manage I should be able to catch up in no time.

## Week 2 Day 2

The constructors and table are a headache. Funny how we take for granted something that is already programmed like excel. 
Each location is its own object. 


## Week 2 Day 3

Reveiewing the code for the lab assignment in class helped me to learn how the constructor works and what I needed to do to my own code to make it work. I will need to work with my css and html to add the assets for the lab today. 


## Week 2 Weekend Journal Entry

After another week and weekend of working on assignments and reading the material, my knowledge continues to grow more and more. Creating a form is difficult and will be needed when working with future clients. CSS to create a more stylistic page is key for catching the eye of your clients consumers or own customers.

## Week 3 Day 1

Added videos to your code can be pretty easy. Creating buttons to stop, pause, and play can be a little more time consuming for the new coder. Creating a random image creator can be easily done but can be tricky if you don't have to correct syntax and understanding of the constructor.

## Week 3 Day 2

Creating a canvas chart can be easily done using the chart.js site. It is great to start from top to bottom with the directions given to a specific chart. 




## Week 3 Day 3

By using certain commands and code you can store info/code into your local storage. This makes your page persistent so that the user can come back to a page and continue where they left off even if the browswer window is closed.

## Week 3 Day 4

301 over view was good to see and hear. It makes me nervous going into deeper knowledge but it will be important for my growth as a developer. The whiteboard was a good feeler to what it will be like for future whiteboard sessions with the class.
